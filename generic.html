								<p>Hello there! I'm Boydo Immanuel Saragih, a passionate geophysics graduate based in Bekasi, West Java, Indonesia. With a current GPA of 3.61/4.00, I recently earned my Bachelor's degree from Universitas Indonesia, where I honed my skills and passion for data analysis and machine learning.</p>

    							<p>During my academic journey, I had the privilege of working as an Assistant Lecturer and Field Assistant at the Department of Geoscience UI, where I contributed to magnetic data acquisition and provided comprehensive learning materials for undergraduate students. I also work as an Assistant Lecturer and Field Assistant at the Department of Geoscience UI, actively engaging in seismic tomography, microtremor analysis, and inversion methods. In this capacity, I gained valuable hands-on experience while simultaneously playing a crucial role in facilitating learning for my peers.</p>

    							<p>As a Bachelor Thesis Student Intern at BMKG, I conducted research on the subsurface structure in South Jakarta, showcasing my commitment to real-world applications of geophysics. I've also interned at Bank Negara Indonesia, PT Pertamina Hulu Energi, and PUSHIDROSAL, where I gained practical experience in credit analysis, seismic data processing, and magnetic data interpretation.</p>

    							<p>I've pursued certifications and training, including the Bangkit Academy by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka, where I became proficient in data collection, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning using Python. Additionally, my achievements in the Zenius SIB Data Analyst course demonstrate my analytical prowess, ranking first in a class of 40.</p>

    							<p>I've showcased my proficiency in various programming languages and tools, including Python and SQL, gaining expertise in data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model development. Additionally, I've honed my skills in feature engineering, scaling, encoding, and dimensionality reduction.</p>

    							<p>That's all of my exciting journey where my passion for data science and geophysics is. Let's explore the world of insights and possibilities together!</p>
